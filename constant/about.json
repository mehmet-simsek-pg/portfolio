  "firstParagraph": "I specialize in building mobile responsive front-end UI applications that connect with APIs and other backend technologies. I am passionate about learning new technologies and understand there is more than one way to accomplish a task. Though I am most proficient in building front-end applications using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React, I am a quick learner and can pick up new tech stacks as needed. I believe that being a great developer is not using one specific language, but choosing the best tool for the job.",
  "secondParagraph": " I started web developement in 2013 managing multiple e-commerce websites on CMS platforms such as WordPress, BigCommerce, and Shopify. I have experience working directly with clients and taking mock wireframes all the way to deployed applications. In my spare time I run Code Commerce, a Youtube channel where I teach web developement and various front-end technologies.",
